# Twitter-satment-analysis
twitter is a place where many people write what they feel either was a good thing or a bad thing so we have tried to know what people feel  based on the data set that we have. 
# The Data that we have
so we have 
col_names = ["target", "ids", "date", "flag", "user", "text"]
target : is it good or bad (1:pos ,0: neg) 
ids: The id of the tweet ( 2087)
date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
